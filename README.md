Hello! 👋 

My name is Nicholas Campanini. I'm a software engineer that likes JavaScript, teaching, and endlessly learning. 

## About me 🎸 

In a previous life, I graduated with a degree in music and studied classical guitar, but have since earned a degree in Information Sciences and have been doing software development professionally for more than 10 years.

My preferred coding language is JavaScript (and it's many tools/frameworks, i.e. TypeScript, Angular, Node), but have done plenty of .NET development on the server side, along with copious amounts of SQL.

I enjoy the creative side of coding the most, and find fulfillment in mentoring juniors and pointing students in the right direction for their careers.
